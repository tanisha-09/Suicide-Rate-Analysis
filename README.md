# Suicide-Rate-Analysis
This project is dedicated to employing association rule mining as a powerful tool to unearth the intricate web of factors contributing to both high and low suicide rates. Suicide stands as a global public health crisis, impacting millions of lives annually. Drawing upon data encompassing demographic, socioeconomic, and mental health-related variables, we intend to leverage association rule mining techniques to uncover prevailing combinations of factors intricately linked to elevated or reduced suicide rates.

The outcomes of this endeavor hold the promise of guiding precisely tailored suicide prevention initiatives and policy formulation. By acquiring an in-depth understanding of the multifaceted determinants of suicide, we aspire to craft prevention strategies that will effectively curtail the incidence of suicide. The utilization of association rule mining in this context is pivotal as it enables the identification of prevalent combinations of factors associated with suicide, thereby facilitating the development of precise and targeted interventions.

In summary, the overarching objective of this project is to harness the capabilities of association rule mining to gain profound insights into the complex matrix of factors influencing suicide. This knowledge will empower us to pinpoint high-risk populations and, in turn, craft prevention strategies aimed at reducing the prevalence of suicide.
